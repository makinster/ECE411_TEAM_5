Practicum Idea 

1.) Draw Pad -
The draw pad will use sensors (touch sensors?) that captures some form of contact and will record 
the contact movements and will either display them on a screen or a panel of LEDs will show the display. 
Using a microcontroller to output the movements to an LED display.

2.) Chronograph -
The chronograph will measure the time an object travles between two IR gates and calculate velocity.
Then the machine will display its result on an LED screen. 

3.) USB power-ometer
This gadget will measure the voltage and amperage that flows between a simple USB port to the other USB port.
When the device is connected to a power source and the device that is being recharged through an USB port,
the seven segment display will show the voltage and current values in real time. 

4) Water Heater/kettle
This device will be comprised of three elements: a temperature probe, heating element and leds for feedback.
The device will be used to heat up a beaker of water. The temperature of the water will be measured and displayed
on a set of leds. There will be 4 leds which correspond to 5, different states: off, heat on but cold, heat on but
medium, heat on and hot, and heat on and boiling. When the device reaches a boiling temperature, it will begin to 
toggle between a heating on state and a heating off state in order to maintain the water's temperature.
