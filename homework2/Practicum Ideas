Practicum Idea 

1.) Draw Pad -
The draw pad will use sensors (touch sensors?) that captures some form of contact and will record 
the contact movements and will either display them on a screen or a panel of LEDs will show the display. 
Using a microcontroller to output the movements to an LED display.

2.) Chronograph -
The chronograph will measure the time an object travles between two IR gates and calculate velocity.
Then the machine will display its result on an LED screen. 

3.) USB power-ometer
This gadget will measure the voltage and amperage that flows between a simple USB port to the other USB port.
When the device is connected to a power source and the device that is being recharged through an USB port,
the seven segment display will show the voltage and current values in real time.
